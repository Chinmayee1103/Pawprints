# PawPrints - Pet Adoption & Care App
PawPrints is a Flutter-based mobile application aimed at promoting pet adoption, offering an e-commerce platform for pet care products, and helping to rescue stray animals. The app is built with Firebase for authentication and backend services and utilizes Flutter's geolocation features to connect users and organizations for pet rescue and care.

## Features
1. Pet Adoption
The first screen allows organizations to present the pets available for adoption. Users can browse through available pets and contact the organization to initiate the adoption process.
2. Pet Care (E-Commerce Platform)
The second screen serves as an e-commerce platform for both users and organizations to buy essential pet care products. Users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases.
3. Helping Hands (Stray Pet Rescue)
The third screen is a social feature where users can report stray pets they’ve found by uploading the pet’s details and a photo. The app uses the geolocator and geocoding packages to pinpoint the user's location and notify nearby organizations about the stray animal for rescue.
4. Firebase Integration
Firebase is used for authentication (login and signup) and for storing user and product data, providing a reliable and scalable backend solution.
